MorseTrainer
============

Author: Martin Sivak <mars@montik.net>
Based on: my own design
Started in: Mar 2012

Schematics is in directory sch/
Firmware in directory firmware/


Goals
=====

- pocket sized device which can randomly select a morse symbol from the subset I am just learning and output morse code followed by it's spoken representation
- morse would be sent do headphones using selectable pitch and also blinked on LED
- after the correct answer, a button will be used to mark if I answered correctly as well (score tracking :)
- menus will be spoken using samples stored on flash chip (8kHz sample rate, 8bit)
- morse speed should be selectable (5 - 40wpm?)
- morse key stereo jack input to allow for future sending practice, the input might be also switchable to some digital form (PC communication)
- volume will be controllable by software (rotary encoder, morse key?)

Devices
=======

ATtiny861A CPU (8kB flash, 512B RAM, 512B EEPROM)
LM386N headphone amplifier
A25L40PU 4Mbit SPI flash (about 64s worth of audio when using 8kHz sample rate)
MCP4251-104 100k dual channel SPI digital potentiometer

Architecture
============


A25L40PU Flash
==============

   0 B \_ indexing table, 256 entries in the form (3B starting address, 2B length)
1279 B /  standard characters will be at their ascii position, the rest will have special numbers

1280 B \_ sample data, raw audio samples in mono 8bit, 8kHz samplerate (65.37s) 
 end   /

ATtiny861 EEPROM
================

Morse table:
- array of morse characters ordered in learning sequence
- each character entry has three bytes
  [5 reserved bits, L2, L1, L0]
  [8 bit ID]
  [D7, D6, D5, D4, D3, D2, D1, D0]

  L<2:0> represents the number of dit/dahs in the character in the range <1,8> (no of didahs = L+1)
  ID<7:0> is index to the table with audio recordings (and also ascii representation where applicable)
  D<7:0> are dit/dahs - 0 = dit and 1 = dah, only L least significant bits are used, D0 is played first

  the table will be constructed using macro MORSE(<ID>, DIT, DAH, ...)
